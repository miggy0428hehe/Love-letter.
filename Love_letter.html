        My Dearest Asaleah,

        Happy 1 year and 7 months to us!! From the moment we met, you brought a warmth into my life that I never knew was missing. 
        Each day with you feels like a beautiful adventure, filled with laughter, love, and joy. 
        Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your laughter is music to my ears.

        I cherish the little moments we share—the way your hand fits perfectly in mine, 
        the soft look in your eyes when you’re deep in thought, and the gentle way you care for those around you. 
   

        I admire your strength and kindness, and I am grateful for your support and love. 
        You inspire me to be a better person, and I can’t imagine my life without you by my side. 

        As we continue this journey together, I want you to know that my heart is yours, now and always. 
        Thank you for being you for being my everything, my world, My TAM.

        With all my love,

        Miggy<3
